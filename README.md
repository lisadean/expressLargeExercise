Create an express app that pulls information from other APIs (or scrapes the text from other websites) and then displays it.

* use a 3rd party npm module to make requests (e.g., request, request-promise)
* if you are scraping text, use the cheerio module

Use a route parameter for the URL (or API endpoint) to pull data from.

Feel free to add additional route parameters to specify any kind of sorting/filtering you want to do with the data before it is sent back in a response.
